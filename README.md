# 🎨 Eigenvalue Visualizer & Calculator
A beautifully animated **React Canvas Application** that visualizes how a 2×2 matrix transforms space — including **eigenvalues, eigenvectors, stretching, rotation, and deformation**.

This project combines:
- 🧮 **Eigenvalue & eigenvector computation**
- 🎥 **Smooth canvas animations**
- 🌸 **Flower-like transformation art patterns**
- ⚛️ **React (Hooks + Refs)**

Perfect for students, teachers, and anyone learning Linear Algebra visually.

## 🚀 Overview
This project provides two core components:

### **1️⃣ Eigenvalue Calculator (2×2 Matrix)**
Solves eigenvalues & properties for a matrix:

\[ A = \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} \]

It computes:
- ⭐ Determinant
- ⭐ Trace
- ⭐ Discriminant
- ⭐ Eigenvalues (real/complex)
- ⭐ Type of transformation

All results appear instantly with a clean, modern UI.

### **2️⃣ React Canvas Animation (Matrix Flower Art)**
A mesmerizing animation that shows how multiplying vectors by matrix **A** creates evolving geometric patterns:
- 🌺 Flower patterns
- 🌀 Rotations for complex eigenvalues
- ⬆️ Stretching along eigenvectors
- 🎚️ Play / Pause / Reset controls

Users see how matrix behavior changes over time — a visual approach to understanding linear transformations.

## 🌈 Visual Experience
This project is designed to be **aesthetically pleasing** and educational:
- Soft neon glow effects
- Dynamic motion trails
- Smooth transitions
- Clean UI with Lucide icons
- Dark, modern, sci‑fi theme

The animation is not only educational — it feels like **math art**.
